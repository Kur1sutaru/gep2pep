## Repo

Pathway Expression Profiles (PEPs) are based on the expression of
pathways (defined as sets of genes) as opposed to individual
genes. This package converts gene expression profiles to PEPs and
performs enrichment analysis of modules or perturbagens, such as "drug
set enrichment analysis" and "gene2drug" drug discovery analysis.

A [paper](http://rdcu.be/pklt) about drug set enrichment analysis has
been published in Bioinformatics, and a
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/192005) about gene2drug analysis is
currently on BioRxiv.

Gep2pep is maintained by Francesco Napolitano [![alt text][1.2]][1]
