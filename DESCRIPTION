Description: Pathway Expression Profiles (PEPs) are based on the
    expression of pathways (defined as sets of genes) as opposed to
    individual genes. This package converts gene expression profiles
    to PEPs and performs enrichment analysis of both pathways and
    experimental conditions, such as "drug set enrichment analysis"
    and "gene2drug" drug discovery analysis respectively.
